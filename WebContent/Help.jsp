	<h2>ReverseOreo User's Guide</h2>
<p>The purpose of this page is to give you some information on the purpose and design of this site.</p>

<dt>General Information</dt>
<p>This is an on-line travel reservation system that will allow customers to make flight reservations. Both domestic and international flights are supported.</p>
<dt>Features of the Site</dt>

<p>Each page will have the same features and layouts for an easy to navigate site.</p> 
The ReverseOreo Home Page is a basic sign in page with a navigation bar on top. The user can sign in as a customer or as an employee. If they don't have an account yet they can click on the signup button in the upper right corner of the navigation bar. This will direct them to a sign-up page where the user will input their information for a customer account.
Once logged, the user's page will be directed to their account home page. Depending on whether the user signed in as a customer or employee, the navigation bar will update accordingly. There will be links to the user's dashboard, settings, and an option to logout. In addition, the ReverseOreo text will now have functionality so when it is clicked on you are taken to a flight search page.
The Dashboards allow the user to view certain information or to handle data. Customers are only able to view their own data such as account information and current reservations, while employees are able to do more, like recording reservations, and editing customers. Everything is easily accessible through a tab pane.</p>
